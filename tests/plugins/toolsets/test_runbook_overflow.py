TDD Red Tests for Runbook Fetcher Context Overflow

These tests expose bugs where large runbook content can cause context window
overflow. The fetch_runbook tool returns runbook content WITHOUT any size limit,
and wraps it with additional instructions (~2KB), further increasing size.

Key issues:
1. Runbook content from DAL (Supabase) has no size limit
2. MD file runbooks have no size limit
3. The XML wrapper adds significant overhead
4. Multiple runbook fetches accumulate without limit
